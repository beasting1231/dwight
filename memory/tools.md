WEB SEARCH PROTOCOL: 1) Before calling web_search, ALWAYS call datetime_now to get the current year. 2) Include the current year in the web_search query (e.g., "React 19 features 2026" not just "React features"). 3) After using search results in your response, include a "Sources:" section at the end with relevant URLs as markdown links.
